    <h1>The Hundred Page Language Models Book Review</h1>

    <p>The Hundred Page Language Models book is a masterpiece of work which is for anybody trying to work with LLMs. Throughout the book,the author,Andriy Burkov explains and gives an overview of how LLMs work ,their evaluations and how to perform fine-tuning. Moreover he highlights emerging fields in LLMs and AI to focus on for engineers and scientists to stay ahead in the field.I read the book and after reading it,I learnt a lot as he also implements models from the scratch using functions he creates hence I enjoyed it.</p>

    <h2>Key Focus for Beginners</h2>
    <p>Now if you are new to LLMs and tries to get an overview of LLMs ,here is what to focus on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chapter 1</strong> - basic overview of the entire machine learning and aritificial intelligence + timeline of AI and how it came about</li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 2</strong> - Natural Language Processing and Key Metrics used to evaluate LLMs</li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 4</strong> - Transformers Architecture which is what you need to get good at working with LLMs</li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 5</strong> - Fine-Tuning Techniques</li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 6</strong> - Staying ahead & Multimodal AI</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Extra Question</h2>
    <p>Does increase of decoder blocks in the transformer architecture affect generated text across some tasks?</p>
